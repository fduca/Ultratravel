### Key Considerations

##### How will your app handle data persistence?
The only data that will be persisted are the favourites. The app will use a content provider to store the data for the user.

##### Describe any corner cases in the UX.
The back button is an historic back so it will follow the flow of actions the user took backwards.

##### Describe any libraries youâ€™ll be using and share your reasoning for including them.
Picasso: this library is used for image handling
Firebase: this library is used to handle any static data (e.g. locations availables, locations main information and main image)
Retrofit: this library is used to handle HTTP requests
Play services - maps : this library is used to handle map view for the places of interest
